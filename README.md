<p>
  When your logging in OS Ticket as an administrator, you'll have plethora of options. Here you'll be able to create agents; Agents are users who will be assigned and managing tickets depending on permissions. You also have the ability to create departments and teams to work on specific issues/inquiries. The Admin Panel will be your main panel for all your adminstrative settings; from SLA's to 'Help Topics'. 
  
  
  When creating agents you'll be able to assign them to a team, specific permissions, access, and roles. (see sceenshot below)

The screenshot above shows how we can utilize the agent panel. The agent panel lets us create users so tickets can be attached to names/departments. In other words... The tickets have an owner to create better communication, allowing us as agents to troubleshoot more effectively. Users can be added or created anytime. The image below shows our user "Michael Scott" having issues with a printer.
